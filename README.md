Using publicly available voting records to map and determine if your neighbors have voted yet.

# Started
Began as a concept on 22-OCT-2024 with assistance from the RGV Cybver Discord. 
The idea is simple: Grab voter rosters and the address field, then allow those to be mapped. Input your address to see if your neighbors appear on the rolls. 

# Why
Elections are too important for people to sit out, but how do you know who may need help getting to polls or who may need more information on a candidate if you don't know who's voting? Information can be powerful.
